# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using Machine Learning.  
Built using Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and Jupyter Notebook.

## 📂 Project Overview
- Dataset: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
- Goal: Predict passenger survival based on features like age, gender, class, etc.
- Model Used: Logistic Regression / Random Forest (you can specify)
- Evaluation Metric: Accuracy Score

## ⚙️ Steps Involved
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature engineering  
4. Model training and evaluation  
5. Making predictions on new data

## 📊 Results
Achieved **X% accuracy** on the test set.

## 🧠 Libraries Used
- pandas  
- numpy  
- scikit-learn  
- matplotlib / seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook
